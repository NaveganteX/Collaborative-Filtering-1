# Collaborative-Filtering

**Language:** Python 3.6 <br>
**Library:** scikit-learn

In this project, we will build recommendation systems using collaborative filtering methods to infer user interests. The basic idea of collaborative filtering methods is to recommend users items that other similar users have liked. In this project, we will implement and analyze the performance of two types of collaborative filtering methods:<br>

• Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering<br>
• Model-based collaborative filtering<br>

The dataset that we will use is the MovieLens dataset.
